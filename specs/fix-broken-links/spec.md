# Feature: Fix Broken Links

## User Stories

### US1: Fix all broken links

As a developer, I want to fix all the broken links in the website so that the user experience is not affected.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The `yarn build` command does not report any broken links or anchors.
- All links in the website are pointing to valid pages and sections.
