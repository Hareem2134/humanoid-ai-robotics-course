title: Nav2 for Path Planning
---

Nav2 is the second generation of the ROS Navigation Stack. It is a powerful and flexible navigation framework that can be used to control a robot as it moves from one location to another. Nav2 is highly configurable and can be used with a wide variety of robots, including differential drive robots, omnidirectional robots, and even bipedal humanoids.

## Key Components of Nav2

The Nav2 stack is composed of several key components that work together to provide a complete navigation solution:

*   **Global Planner:** This component is responsible for finding a path from the robot's current location to a goal location. The global planner typically uses a search-based algorithm such as A* or Dijkstra's algorithm.
*   **Local Planner:** This component is responsible for generating motor commands that will drive the robot along the global path while avoiding obstacles. The local planner typically uses a reactive algorithm such as the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA).
*   **Costmap:** The costmap is a 2D grid that represents the robot's environment. The costmap is used by both the global and local planners to find a safe path to the goal.
*   **Behavior Trees:** Nav2 uses behavior trees to orchestrate the different components of the navigation stack. Behavior trees are a powerful and flexible way to define complex behaviors, and they allow you to easily customize the behavior of the navigation stack.

## Path Planning for Humanoid Robots

Path planning for bipedal humanoid robots is a challenging problem because of the high dimensionality of the robot's state space and the complexity of its dynamics. However, Nav2 can be adapted to work with humanoid robots by using a custom local planner that is designed to handle the specific challenges of bipedal locomotion.

In the next section, we will explore how to use reinforcement learning to train robots to perform complex tasks.
