title: Capstone Project
---

The capstone project for this book is **The Autonomous Humanoid**. In this project, you will bring together everything you have learned to create a simulated humanoid robot that can understand natural language commands, navigate its environment, and manipulate objects.

## Project Goal

The goal of the project is to create a system where you can give a voice command to a simulated humanoid robot, and the robot will perform the requested task. For example, you could say:

> "Robot, please pick up the red block and place it on the blue block."

The robot should then be able to:

1.  **Understand the command:** Use a conversational AI system to transcribe the speech to text and understand the user's intent.
2.  **Plan the task:** Use a large language model to break down the high-level command into a sequence of smaller, more manageable actions.
3.  **Navigate to the object:** Use the Nav2 stack to navigate to the location of the red block.
4.  **Pick up the object:** Use its manipulator to pick up the red block.
5.  **Navigate to the destination:** Navigate to the location of the blue block.
6.  **Place the object:** Place the red block on top of the blue block.

## Project Components

The project will involve integrating several of the key technologies that we have learned about in this book:

*   **ROS 2:** For communication between the different components of the system.
*   **Gazebo or Isaac Sim:** For simulating the robot and its environment.
*   **Conversational AI:** For understanding the user's voice commands.
*   **Large Language Models:** For task planning.
*   **Nav2:** For navigation.
*   **Manipulation:** For picking and placing objects.

This capstone project will be a challenging but rewarding experience. By the end of it, you will have a fully functional autonomous humanoid robot that you can interact with and command using your voice.
