title: Conversational AI for Robotics
---

Conversational AI is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand and generate human language. In robotics, conversational AI can be used to create a more natural and intuitive interface for controlling and interacting with robots.

## Speech-to-Text

The first step in creating a conversational interface is to convert the user's speech into text. This can be done using a speech-to-text (STT) engine such as **OpenAI Whisper**. Whisper is a powerful and accurate STT engine that can transcribe speech in a variety of languages and accents.

## Natural Language Understanding

Once the user's speech has been converted to text, the next step is to understand the meaning of the text. This is done using a natural language understanding (NLU) model. NLU models can be used to identify the user's intent and to extract key information from the text, such as the objects and locations that the user is referring to.

**Large Language Models (LLMs)**, such as GPT-3, are often used for NLU. These models are trained on massive datasets of text and can be fine-tuned to perform a wide variety of NLU tasks.

## Natural Language Generation

After the user's intent has been understood, the robot can take action and then generate a response in natural language. This is done using a natural language generation (NLG) model. NLG models can be used to generate a wide variety of responses, from simple confirmations to complex explanations.

Again, LLMs are often used for NLG. By providing the LLM with a prompt that describes the desired response, you can generate a natural and human-like response from the robot.

In the next section, we will bring everything together in our capstone project: The Autonomous Humanoid.
