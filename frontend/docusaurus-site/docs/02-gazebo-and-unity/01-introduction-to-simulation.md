title: Introduction to Simulation
---

Simulation is a critical tool in robotics, allowing us to test and develop robots in a virtual environment before deploying them in the real world. This reduces the risk of damage to expensive hardware and allows for rapid iteration on designs and algorithms.

In this module, we will explore two popular simulation platforms: Gazebo and Unity.
