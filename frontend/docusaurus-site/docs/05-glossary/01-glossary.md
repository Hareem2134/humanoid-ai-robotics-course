This glossary provides definitions for key terms and acronyms used throughout this book.

### A

*   **Action:** A communication pattern in ROS 2 for long-running tasks that provide feedback.
*   **Agent:** In reinforcement learning, the agent is the learner and decision-maker.

### C

*   **Costmap:** A 2D grid that represents the robot's environment, used for navigation.

### D

*   **DDS (Data Distribution Service):** A middleware standard that provides the communication layer for ROS 2.
*   **Digital Twin:** A virtual representation of a physical object or system.

### F

*   **Forward Kinematics:** The process of calculating the position and orientation of a robot's end-effector from its joint angles.

### G

*   **Gazebo:** A popular open-source robotics simulator.
*   **Global Planner:** In Nav2, the component that finds a path from the robot's current location to a goal location.

### I

*   **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit):** A sensor that measures a robot's orientation, angular velocity, and linear acceleration.
*   **Inverse Kinematics:** The process of calculating the joint angles that will place the robot's end-effector in a desired position and orientation.
*   **Isaac Sim:** A robotics simulation and synthetic data generation platform from NVIDIA.

### L

*   **LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging):** A sensor that measures distances to objects using laser light.
*   **LLM (Large Language Model):** A type of artificial intelligence model that is trained on massive datasets of text and can be used for natural language understanding and generation.
*   **Local Planner:** In Nav2, the component that generates motor commands to drive the robot along the global path while avoiding obstacles.

### N

*   **Nav2:** The second generation of the ROS Navigation Stack.
*   **Node:** The smallest unit of execution in ROS 2.
*   **NLU (Natural Language Understanding):** The process of understanding the meaning of human language.
*   **NLG (Natural Language Generation):** The process of generating human-like language.

### P

*   **Policy:** In reinforcement learning, the policy is the agent's strategy for choosing actions.
*   **Publisher:** In ROS 2, a node that sends messages to a topic.

### R

*   **rclpy:** The Python client library for ROS 2.
*   **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** A machine learning paradigm where an agent learns to achieve a goal by interacting with an environment.
*   **Reward:** In reinforcement learning, a numerical signal that indicates how well the agent is doing.
*   **ROS (Robot Operating System):** A flexible framework for writing robot software.
*   **RViz2:** A 3D visualization tool for ROS 2.

### S

*   **SDF (Simulation Description Format):** An XML format for describing simulation environments.
*   **Service:** A request-response communication pattern in ROS 2.
*   **Sim-to-Real Transfer:** The process of transferring a policy learned in simulation to a physical robot.
*   **State:** In reinforcement learning, a description of the current situation of the agent and the environment.
*   **STT (Speech-to-Text):** The process of converting spoken language into text.
*   **Subscriber:** In ROS 2, a node that receives messages from a topic.

### T

*   **Topic:** A named bus over which nodes can exchange messages in ROS 2.

### U

*   **Unity:** A popular game engine used for photorealistic robotics simulation.
*   **URDF (Unified Robot Description Format):** An XML format for representing a robot model.

### V

*   **VLA (Vision-Language-Action):** A type of AI model that can understand and act upon multimodal inputs.
*   **VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping):** A technique that allows a robot to build a map of its environment while simultaneously tracking its own location within that map.
