title: Introduction to ROS 2
---

ROS 2 is a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications. It is a complete rewrite of ROS 1, designed to be more reliable, secure, and scalable.

In this module, we will cover the fundamentals of ROS 2, including its architecture, communication patterns, and robot modeling. By the end of this module, you will be able to build complex robotic systems using ROS 2.
