title: Introduction to ROS 2
---

The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms.

## A Brief History of ROS

ROS was originally developed in 2007 at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and later continued at Willow Garage. It quickly became the de facto standard for robotics research and development, thanks to its open-source nature and a vibrant community.

## The Need for ROS 2

While ROS 1 has been incredibly successful, it was designed primarily for academic research and had some limitations, particularly in multi-robot systems, real-time applications, and production environments. These limitations led to the development of ROS 2, which was designed from the ground up to be more reliable, secure, and scalable.

## Key Features of ROS 2

ROS 2 introduces several key features and improvements over ROS 1:

*   **Improved Communication:** ROS 2 is built on top of the Data Distribution Service (DDS) standard, which provides a more robust and flexible communication system.
*   **Support for Real-time Systems:** ROS 2 is designed to be used in real-time applications, with support for real-time operating systems and deterministic execution.
*   **Enhanced Security:** ROS 2 includes a comprehensive security system that provides authentication, encryption, and access control.
*   **Support for Multiple Platforms:** ROS 2 is designed to be cross-platform, with support for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

In this module, we will cover the fundamentals of ROS 2, including its architecture, communication patterns, and robot modeling. By the end of this module, you will be able to build complex robotic systems using ROS 2.
