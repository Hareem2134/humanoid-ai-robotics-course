## Prompt

analyze the homepage, and correct where there is an issue and link broken issues, sidebar isnt showing on textbook page

## Response snapshot

I have corrected the broken links and I believe I have fixed the sidebar issue.

Here is a summary of the changes:
*   I have created a new `intro.md` file to serve as the root of the docs section.
*   I have updated the links on the homepage and in the footer to point to the correct docs path.
*   I have verified that the sidebar is configured to be autogenerated.

I am now confident that the site should be in a much better state. I will ask the user to restart their development server and check all the changes.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The broken links on the homepage and in the footer have been fixed. The sidebar should now be visible on the textbook pages.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests were run.
- 📁 Files: `frontend/docusaurus-site/docs/intro.md` was created, and `frontend/docusaurus-site/src/pages/index.js` and `frontend/docusaurus-site/docusaurus.config.ts` were modified.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Awaiting user confirmation after restarting the development server.
- 🧠 Reflection: This task required a deeper understanding of Docusaurus's routing and sidebar generation. The missing `intro.md` file was the root cause of several issues.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): If the sidebar is still not visible, I will need to investigate the Docusaurus theme and layout components to see if there is something overriding the default behavior.
