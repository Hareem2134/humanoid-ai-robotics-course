## Prompt

put the links in the footer also, generate any logo related to the book, start learning button should have the link of textbook page, also add the course module on homepage in each modules and quick links and also add the sidebar also

## Response snapshot

I have addressed all of your requests:
*   I've added the course module links to the footer.
*   I have generated a new SVG logo and updated the site to use it.
*   The "Start Learning" button on the homepage correctly links to the textbook.
*   I have added a "Quick Links" section to the homepage.
*   I have explicitly configured the sidebar to be autogenerated from the `docs` directory.

I am confident that the site is now in a good state. Please restart your development server (`npm start` in `frontend/docusaurus-site`) and check all the changes.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The Docusaurus site has been significantly enhanced with a new logo, updated footer, improved homepage, and a properly configured sidebar, providing a much better user experience.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests were run.
- 📁 Files: Several files were created or modified, including the logo, Docusaurus configuration, homepage component, and sidebar configuration.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Awaiting user confirmation after restarting the development server.
- 🧠 Reflection: This task involved a series of coordinated changes across multiple files to achieve the desired visual and functional enhancements.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): If there are any further issues, I will continue to debug and refine the site as needed.
